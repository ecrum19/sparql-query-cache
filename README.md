## Publish

You find an example configs in the folder `configs`:
- Use `github.json` if your repo is on GitHub.
- Use `gitlab.json` if your repo is on Gitlab.

These configs tell the Spec Platform to create a new build of the spec for every commit.
The platform will install the Node.js dependencies and run the build script.
The first time the platform only creates a build for the latest commit.
You find more information about configs 
[here](https://gitlab.ilabt.imec.be/KNoWS/spec-platform/orchestrator#spec-config).
Add your updated config file with a meaningful name to 
[this folder](https://gitlab.ilabt.imec.be/KNoWS/spec-platform/pipeline/-/tree/main/configs?ref_type=heads)
via a merge request.
